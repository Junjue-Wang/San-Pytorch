# San-Pytorch
Let us try implementing SAN in pytorch from scratch
The original implementation of Stacked Attention Networks for Image Question Answering by Zichao Yang was in Theano . During my winter intern at IIT-K on VQA let me first implement this in pytorch and then begin my work .
Kindly refer to the [paper]['https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02274'] and the original theano code before proceeding .
