# San-Pytorch
Let us try implementing SAN in pytorch from scratch
The original implementation of Stacked Attention Networks for Image Question Answering by Zichao Yang was in Theano . During my winter intern at IIT-K on VQA let me first implement this in pytorch and then begin my work .
Kindly refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02274) and the original [theano](https://github.com/zcyang/imageqa-san) code before proceeding .
You could also refer to the [torch](https://github.com/JamesChuanggg/san-torch) implementation of SAN .
